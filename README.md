<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is a Weather web application. In this project, the following features were implemented;

- A page displays the data of the current location of the user with the use of ipfind API.
- A user can search for a specific location.
- A user is also presented with the functionality of choosing a location from a dropdown list of possible city search.
- A user can toggle the data to display in Fahrenheit or Celsius.
- The look of the page is changed based on the data from a searched location.
- A user can toggle tabs to see a 5-day forecast of the searched location. 
- The project also has the feature for users adding, saving and deleting three locations for live updates on the city's weather info.
- The project also has an additional feature where a user can also read up weather news highlights for the day.


The main goal is to build a full-fledged web app using a Weather API and also practice the use of Promise and Async/Await in making API calls.
